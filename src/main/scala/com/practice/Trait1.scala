    //Traits are like interfaces in Java. But they are more powerful than the interface in Java because
    // in the traits you are allowed to implement the members. Traits can have methods(both
    // abstract and non-abstract), and fields as its members.

    //Note: we are allowed to implement the method(only abstract methods) in traits. If a trait contains method
    // implementation, then the class which extends this trait need not implement the method which already implemented
    // in a trait.

    // We can inherit a class and multiple trait together also !

    //1- Traits does not contain constructor parameters.
    //2- An "abstract class" can also inherit traits by using extends keyword.
    //3- In Scala, one trait can inherit another trait by using a extends keyword.
    //4- Traits support multiple inheritance: a class can inherit both normal classes or abstract class and traits
    //by using extends keyword before the class name and with keyword before the traitâ€™s name
